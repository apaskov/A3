			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
				<h3>Exploration Question</h3>
				<p>Despite their proximity, the beginning of the 20th and 21st centuries were very different times in America. As such, I'm curious how the age distributions for men and women vary in both periods — perhaps better modern medicine skews the current distribution towards older age, but perhaps the baby boomers reversed the effects of this.</p>
	  <h3>Sketches</h3>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>At a high level, I was hoping this sketch would reveal age distribution changes via reversals of the dot's orderings; more specifically, how on the LHS (1900) the dots uniformly decrease from age 0 being the most populous, then age 5, and so on — and on the RHS (2000) the ordering would be different, revealing how some age groups outpaced others. Also, "crossings" that occur between lines between the two axes indicate distributional changes, so a graph with significant crossing essentially indicates a highly changed distribution.</li>
				<li>Ultimately, the aforementioned design goals were achieved — there was significant crossing, showing that the age distributions changed. Unfortunately, however, gleaning much more detail beyond this is very difficult for several reasons. For one, the points have very similar populations and therefore cluster around small areas of the graph, making chaotic and it very difficult to read (to the point where I did not continue plotting the data as it just got more confusing). </li>
				<li>Given these observations, my next sketch will aim to represent the desired differences in a more compact yet understandable manner.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Iterating off of the last sketch, I again was hoping to reveal how the age distributions changed using a heatmap based on line density (rather than color, just to try something new out as suggested). This, at least initially, seemed to also be a more compact and simpler representation, as one just needs to look at the "heat" associated with a [Gender, Age] combination to see how it changed from 1900 to 2000.</li>
				<li>I liked the heatmap aspect of the chart, as it immediately reveals that the older groups outpaced the rate at which they grew relative to the younger groups. Therefore, the simplicity of observations was achieved. However, I don't like the line-density approach to the heatmap more than color as it is significantly harder to glean exactly how much a group grew (you need to count the number of ticks in each box, which is a lot of work). It also oversimplifies the distribution, as we are not given information on how one [Gender, Age] combination compares to another, which is in my opinion valuable information regarding our overall question.</li>
				<li>Given the observations, I want my next sketch to portray more detail of the distributions while still maintaining the immediate interpretability present in this visualization.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For the final iteration of the sketching process, I'm hoping to strike a good balance between interpretability (better than the first) and detail (more than the second). As such, directly plotting the histograms and juxtaposing them by placing their bases together achieves this very well — at least intuitively, as I have no drawn the sketch yet.</li>
				<li>Overall, this is my favorite sketch as the viewer can immediately glean differences between the two distributions, while also being presented with sufficient (though not overpowering / chaotic) detail that enables them to explore their own questions and comparisons.</li>
				<li>One aspect that sticks out to me, however, is the lack of symmetry and aesthetics of this graph, which I plan to iterate on in phase 2. This is especially present when one also visualizes the distributions of the females as well. Namely, while the overall structure of the graph makes sense, I question whether juxtaposing the years in a single "male population" graph makes sense, or instead the years should be in two different graphs.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        As is clear from the reflections and bullets above, this iterative process of sketching was surprisingly effective for my creative process. In particular,
		I was able to quickly iterate on my ideas, while also having complete flexibility as I was not constrained to a piece of software but rather free to draw
		anything I could come up with.
		While my initial idea presented all of the information given in the data (which, in my opinion, is a valuable trait), it was very difficult to interpret and
		draw non-trivial assumptions from. My second visualization seemed to be a step in the right direction, as it was much more compact and easier to interpret,
		but unfortunately compressed the information too much, making it difficult to fully answer the desired exploration question of how the age distributions changed.
		Finally, my third visualization was a good balance between the two, and I believe it is the best visualization; however, there are still some 
		weaknesses of this visualization, which I plan to address in the next phase by synthesizing elements from the first sketches 
		— for example through swapping the order in which measures are presented, and using color to emphasize natural groupings.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				I chose to stick to the same question as in phase one: "how [do] the age distributions for men and women vary in both periods — perhaps better modern medicine skews the current distribution towards older age, but perhaps the baby boomers reversed the effects of this" as it is something I am genuinely very curious about, given my background in medical developmental history. Drawing on the final sketch from phase one, I made another visualization based on juxtaposing the histograms; however, I synthesized more elements from the other two visualizations, such as incorporating symmetry for "visual simplicity," as well as color. I also wanted to focus on sketch three as it includes non-trivial data rotations and graph manipulations that I strongly felt would help me become much more fluent with Tableau.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving onto my design decisions, my visualization depicts population histograms, comparing the age distribution of men and women in the United States at the beginning of the 20th and 21st centuries (1900 and 2000). In crafting this visualization, my primary goal was to enable clear comparisons between the two time periods. Design choices were driven by a desire to focus on the overall shape and distribution patterns, potentially reflecting changes in life expectancy and broader demographic shifts. As is clear from the chart, such changes did indeed occur, as the population does not monotonically decrease in age (as in 1900) but rather has non-trivial humps around the age groups 10-20 and 35-50, as well as some differing behavior between men and women in 2000. Furthermore, color, scale, and sorting were strategically selected to facilitate comparison: a neutral gray avoids bias, a consistent population scale allows evaluation across years, and ascending age groups ensure intuitive reading. I also omitted population numbers to emphasize relative distribution over absolute values — which appropriately is what my question wanted to focus on.
      </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Overall, I would say that phase one helped my design process. As discussed previously, I iterated over several ideas that were lacking in certain ways and ultimately ended up with a visualization that answered each of the components of my question, cleanly and intuitively. I was also able to utilize the components of each (starkly different) sketch that worked the best to make a final visualization incorporating all components. Furthermore, something that stuck out to me was my inability to foresee issues with my initial sketches (for instance, the chaotic density/clustering around certain populations that appeared in my first visualization); it was exactly through this iterative process of sketching that I was able to iron out such unforeseen problems with my ideas. Finally, looking forward, I am curious about how future iterations of this visualization could strive to be more inclusive of non-binary genders; while I could of course just make more histograms, this visualization would become quite dense with many graphs — so perhaps other ideas (such as the one explored in my second sketch with the heatmap) would be much more appropriate.
